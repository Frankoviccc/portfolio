    "text": "Hey there, I’m Frank Struik — a frontend developer who believes websites should not only work but also feel good.\nI’ve worked on projects big and small, from e-commerce platforms to storytelling websites, and I enjoy the challenge of turning abstract ideas into clean, functional code. My secret superpower? Writing code that future-me (and other developers) can actually read without crying.\nWhen I’m not coding, you might find me experimenting with new tech, hunting for clever UI details online, or trying to convince people that dark mode really does make everything better.",
